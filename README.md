# project-15-ML-Auto_Mpg_Price_Predction
 problems to predict fuel efficiency, we aim to predict the output of a continuous value, such as a price or a probability.
use one of the famous datasets among machine learning practitioners, Auto MPG dataset to create a model to predict fuel efficiency of vehicles in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
